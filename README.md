# Google-UI-Clone
This is Google's dark-themed, logged-out search UI clone made up entirely using HTML, CSS, and JS. 

To search for anything, type normally and hit "Enter". It will perform a Google search.
Since I created it just for fun and curiosity, the webpage's responsiveness has not been taken care of right now. Maybe in the futureðŸ™ƒ
